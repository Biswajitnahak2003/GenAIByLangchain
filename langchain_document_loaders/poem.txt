A whispered word, a gentle touch, a glance across the room,
A silent understanding, banishing all gloom.
A hand in hand, a shared embrace, a journey side by side,
Through sunlit days and stormy nights, with love as our sure guide.

It's laughter shared, a tear wiped dry, a comfort in the pain,
A knowing smile, a trusting heart, a love that will remain.
It's strength and solace, peace and joy, a bond that cannot break,
A sacred flame, forever bright, for love's own precious sake.
It grows with time, a deepening stream, a constant, flowing grace,
A love that fills the empty space, and lights up every place.
